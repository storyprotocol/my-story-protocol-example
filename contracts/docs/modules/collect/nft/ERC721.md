# Solidity API

## ERC721

This is a barebones ERC-721 contract that does not implement the
        ERC-721 metadata standard. This contract is purposely lightweight
        to support simpler standardization for collect NFTs, which:
        - MAY mirror metadata from their bound IP assets, thus not
          necessarily having the metadata defined in the collect NFT itself
        - MUST support initialization via minimal clone proxies, thus not
          requiring a constructor for IP asset specific intialization
        - MAY not be upgradeable, thus not necessarily requiring a more
          involved IERC721Upgradeable extension

### ownerOf

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => address) ownerOf
```

Maps tokens to their owner addresses.

### isApprovedForAll

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) isApprovedForAll
```

Checks for an owner if an address is an authorized operator.

### getApproved

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => address) getApproved
```

Gets the approved address for an NFT.

### balanceOf

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) balanceOf
```

Gets the number of NFTs owned by an address.

### _totalSupply

```solidity
uint256 _totalSupply
```

### setApprovalForAll

```solidity
function setApprovalForAll(address operator_, bool approved_) external
```

Sets the operator for `msg.sender` to `operator`.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| operator_ | address | The operator address managing NFTs of `msg.sender`. |
| approved_ | bool | Whether operator can manage NFTs of `msg.sender`. |

### safeTransferFrom

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from_, address to_, uint256 tokenId_, bytes data_) external
```

Transfers NFT of id `id` from address `from` to address `to`,
 with safety checks ensuring `to` is capable of receiving the NFT.

_Safety checks are only performed if `to` is a smart contract._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| from_ | address | The existing owner address of the NFT to be transferred. |
| to_ | address | The new owner address of the NFT being transferred. |
| tokenId_ | uint256 | The id of the NFT being transferred. |
| data_ | bytes | Additional data in bytes to pass to the receiver. |

### safeTransferFrom

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from_, address to_, uint256 tokenId_) external
```

Transfers NFT of id `id` from address `from` to address `to`,
 with safety checks ensuring `to` is capable of receiving the NFT.

_Safety checks are only performed if `to` is a smart contract._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| from_ | address | The existing owner address of the NFT to be transferred. |
| to_ | address | The new owner address of the NFT being transferred. |
| tokenId_ | uint256 | The id of the NFT being transferred. |

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address approved_, uint256 tokenId_) public virtual
```

Sets approved address of NFT `id` to address `approved`.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| approved_ | address | The new approved address for the NFT. |
| tokenId_ | uint256 | The id of the NFT to approve. |

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from_, address to_, uint256 tokenId_) public virtual
```

Transfers NFT of id `id` from address `from` to address `to`,
 without performing any safety checks.

_Existence of an NFT is inferred by having a non-zero owner address.
 Transfers clear owner approvals without `Approval` events emitted._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| from_ | address | The existing owner address of the NFT being transferred. |
| to_ | address | The new owner address of the NFT being transferred. |
| tokenId_ | uint256 | The id of the NFT being transferred. |

### supportsInterface

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 id_) public view virtual returns (bool)
```

Checks if interface of identifier `id` is supported.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| id_ | bytes4 | The ERC-165 interface identifier. |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | bool | True if interface id `id` is supported, false otherwise. |

### _mint

```solidity
function _mint(address to_, uint256 tokenId_) internal virtual
```

_Mints an NFT of identifier `tokenId` to recipient address `to`._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| to_ | address | Address of the new NFT owner. |
| tokenId_ | uint256 | Id of the NFT being minted. |

### _burn

```solidity
function _burn(uint256 tokenId_) internal virtual
```

_Burns an NFT with identifier `tokenId`._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| tokenId_ | uint256 | The id of the NFT being burned. |
